**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
We learned about graph convolultional neural networks. This was interesting because it showed the challenges that graphs posed for traditional learning algorithms and how GCNs addressed these shortcomings. It was interesting to see how a algorithm that I learned in class like a barebone CNN was adapted for a new data structure like graphs.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
We want to see if we can tell the difference between cells that contain ecDNA vs not. We think that modeling DNA interactions as graphs could give us insight into systematic differences in how ecDNA behaves.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In the start of the Q1 project, our group was somewhat unfamiliar with how the data was sampled and ultimately processed. We assumed this process to be abstracted away. However, because of this assumption, it became difficult for us to write new algorithms like a CNN because we were unfamiliar with the data to an extent. After we went back and followed the data construction step by step, we were in a much better place. So ultimately a new approach would give due diligence to the EDA step.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
We would be interested in seeing how transformers could help us in our classification task. Since transformers are good for learning relationships that may be overlooked in something like an RNN or CNN, we think that if we are able to incorporate graph structure into our data, the transformer model could produce really good results.
